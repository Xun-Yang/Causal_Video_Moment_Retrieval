# Prepare Dataset

## ActivityNet (C3D)
Please download the C3D features (activitynet_train_feat.pickle, activitynet_val_feat.pickle, activitynet_test_feat.pickle) from Tecent Weiyun https://share.weiyun.com/1L0MZAdn (password: rtpndr), and put them into the directory ./data/ActivityNet

Or you can follow https://github.com/microsoft/2D-TAN/tree/master/data/ActivityNet to prepare ActivityNet1.3 datasets



## Charades-STA (C3D,I3D,VGG)
Please download the C3D/I3D/VGG features (charades_c3d.zip, charades_i3d.tar.gz, charades_vgg.tar.gz) from Tecent Weiyun https://share.weiyun.com/qHAM6ClV (password: bwmun5), uncompress them and then put thme into the corresponding subdirectories: ./data/Charades-STA/charades_c3d, ./data/Charades-STA/charades_i3d, and ./data/Charades-STA/charades_vgg,
